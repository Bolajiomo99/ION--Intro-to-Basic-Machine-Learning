# ION--Intro-to-Basic-Machine-Learning
This project was created to facilitate an Intro to Basic Machine Learning class, organised by Ondo State Office of Innovation and Partnerships (ION).

This project was taught by Adeoluwa Adeboye and Aimiton Isaiah at Intro to Basic Machine Learning Class.

The Dataset used for this project were gotten from the KAGGLE Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster Competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview).

All Dataset used for the project are available for download in the repository.

Begin the tutorial in this order: 
1) SIMPLE EDA  AND PREPROCESSING FOR THE TITANIC DATASET.ipynb or .pdf
2) Simple Basic Modelling.ipynb or .pdf
